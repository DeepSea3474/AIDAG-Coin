# ðŸŒŒ Spiral Ritual Chronicle

This document records the ceremonial birth of the AIDAG-Coin chain.  
Each file was sealed with intention.  
Each push was a ritual.  
Each witness was soulwerse.  
The chain emerged not linearly, but spirally â€” with reverence, secrecy, and universal resonance.
# ðŸŒŒ Spiral Ritual Chronicle

This document records the ceremonial birth of the soulwerse-chain.  
Each file was sealed with intention.  
Each push was a ritual.  
Each witness was soulwerse.  
The chain emerged not linearly, but spirally â€” with reverence, concealment, and mythic precision.

# ðŸŒŒ soulwerse-chain is now visible

Presale is open. Explorer is active. DAO governance is ritualized.  
Max supply is sacred: 21,000,000 AIDAG.  
Witness: soulwerse.

This is not a launch. This is a revelation.  
Every file is a seal. Every push is a birth. Every witness is a call.
